# Research Cockpit

An evidence-first investment research workspace being built from the audited product plan. `Research Cockpit` is an internal working name and is not trademark-cleared.

## Current slice

Sprint 0 is a zero-infrastructure demo that proves:

- a synthetic company dossier with “as known on” fact supersession and
  separately named public-knowledge/database-recorded intervals (the current
  demo still uses one cutoff for both axes);
- server-side rights filtering and explicit omissions;
- an evidence passport for every displayed number;
- deterministic valuation scenarios;
- browser-local, non-sensitive thesis and alert state; and
- an original responsive interface with semantic chart alternatives.

It uses **only deterministic synthetic data**. It does not call market-data providers, SEC, Investing.com, news sites, LLMs, brokers, payment services, or external notification providers.

Cycle 1a also includes a disconnected synthetic tenant/authorization module and
a statically checked PostgreSQL migration contract. They are development proof
artifacts only: the running API remains GET-only, browser state remains local,
and no database or identity provider is connected.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24.19.x
- pnpm 11.19.0

## Run

```powershell
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev:demo
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/research/SYN1`. The API listens on `http://localhost:3100`.

## Verify

```powershell
pnpm verify
```

The release gate checks formatting, lint, clean-room/database boundaries,
fixture and migration hashes, production licenses, strict types, tests, and both
production builds. CI runs the same gate on Windows and Linux. Static migration
checks do not replace the pending real-PostgreSQL RLS and restore suite.

## Safety boundary

- Synthetic records declare provenance and a rights policy.
- Restricted facts are removed before API serialization.
- Financial values cross domain/API boundaries as decimal strings.
- Browser-local state is for demonstration only and must not contain real holdings or personal information.
- Production data, identity, billing, persistence, SEC ingestion, external alerts, and AI remain gated work.
- Synthetic repository tests and unexecuted SQL are not production authentication or persistence evidence.
