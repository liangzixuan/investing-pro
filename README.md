# Research Cockpit

An evidence-first investment research workspace being built from the audited product plan. `Research Cockpit` is an internal working name and is not trademark-cleared.

## Current slice

Sprint 0 is a zero-infrastructure demo that proves:

- a synthetic company dossier with bitemporal “as known on” facts;
- server-side rights filtering and explicit omissions;
- an evidence passport for every displayed number;
- deterministic valuation scenarios;
- browser-local, non-sensitive thesis and alert state; and
- an original responsive interface with semantic chart alternatives.

It uses **only deterministic synthetic data**. It does not call market-data providers, SEC, Investing.com, news sites, LLMs, brokers, payment services, or external notification providers.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24.19.x
- pnpm 11.19.0

## Run

```powershell
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev:demo
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/research/SYN1`. The API listens on `http://localhost:3100`.

## Verify

```powershell
pnpm verify
```

The release gate checks formatting, lint, clean-room boundaries, fixture hashes,
production licenses, strict types, tests, and both production builds. CI runs
the same gate on Windows and Linux.

## Safety boundary

- Synthetic records declare provenance and a rights policy.
- Restricted facts are removed before API serialization.
- Financial values cross domain/API boundaries as decimal strings.
- Browser-local state is for demonstration only and must not contain real holdings or personal information.
- Production data, identity, billing, persistence, SEC ingestion, external alerts, and AI remain gated work.
